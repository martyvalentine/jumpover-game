To use Javascript libraries in the Brython code, there are several ways.

https://www.brython.info/static_doc/en/jsobjects.html

The most canonical way is to pass via the 'window' object/module

```
from browser import window

```

Any loaded JavaScript functions (e.g. tone.js) are available from Brython via window.xxx namespace.
